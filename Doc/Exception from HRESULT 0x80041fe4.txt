I encountered the same error when trying to create a C# console app project. I used the steps in JJ Lay's answer to work around the issue. To be clear, these are the steps that I used:

1. Attempt to create a C# console app project (for example, named "TestProj" in Visual Studio 2019
2. Encounter 'Exception from HRESULT 0x80041fe4'
3. Close Visual Studio 2019
4. Open Visual Studio 2019
5. Use the same exact steps and name as in step 1 (for example, "TestProj") and try to create the project again
6. Project is created successfully this time
