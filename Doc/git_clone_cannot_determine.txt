What fixed the issue for me is going to Tools > Options > Source Control > Git Global Settings, there I changed all 4 dropdowns which were still selected as "Unset":

    Prune remote branches during fetch - False
    Rebase local branch when pulling - False
    Cryptographic network provider - OpenSSL
    Credential helper - GCM Core

Note: These are the settings my organization requires. You might have to tweak them around according to your exact issue.
