A static class is basically the same as a non-static class, but there is one difference: a static class cannot be instantiated. 
In other words, you cannot use the new operator to create a variable of the class type. 
Because there is no instance variable, you access the members of a static class by using the class name itself. 
For example, if you have a static class that is named UtilityClass 
that has a public static method named MethodA, you call the method as shown in the following example:

    UtilityClass.MethodA();
