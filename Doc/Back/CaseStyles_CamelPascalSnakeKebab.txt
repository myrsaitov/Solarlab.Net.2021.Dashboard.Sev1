Typically I use pascal case for class definitions, and camel case for variable definitions.

Camel case combines words by capitalizing all words following the first word and removing the space, as follows:
Raw: user login count
Camel Case: userLoginCount
This is a very popular way to combine words to form a single concept. It is often used as a convention in variable declaration in many languages.

Pascal case combines words by capitalizing all words (even the first word) and removing the space, as follows:
Raw: user login count
Pascal Case: UserLoginCount
This is also a very popular way to combine words to form a single concept. It is often used as a convention in declaring classes in many languages.

Snake case combines words by replacing each space with an underscore (_) and, in the all caps version, all letters are capitalized, as follows:
Raw: user login count
Snake Case: user_login_count
Snake Case (All Caps): USER_LOGIN_COUNT
This style, when capitalized, is often used as a convention in declaring constants in many languages. When lower cased, it is used conventionally in declaring database field names.

Kebab case combines words by replacing each space with a dash (-), as follows:
Raw: user login count
Kebab Case: user-login-count
This style is often used in URLs. For example, www.blog.com/cool-article-1. It is a nice, clean, human-readable way to combine the words.
