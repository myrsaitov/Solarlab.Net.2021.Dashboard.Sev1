Absolutely. I often keep a “contracts” project with shared interfaces and DTOs just for this case. This isn’t necessarily all DTOs in all projects but just the ones that are consumable

Yep, highly recommend you create a separate library project just for DTOs. Also recommend strictly avoiding referencing any other projects in the DTO project. It will help you avoid leaking stuff that shouldn't be in a DTO. They should be plain old class objects with no logic to them.
